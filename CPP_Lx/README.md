# C++ Assignments
> Here are some basic question list, refer above solution (if required)

1. Define a point class, where each object represents point in Cartesian
coordinates (x, y). Define objects of this class and calculate the distance
between the 2 points through a friend function.

2. Define polar class where each object represents point in polar coordinates
(angle and radius). Include static data member which keeps track the number
of active objects of the class.

3. Define a complex class, define default constructor, parameterized constructors
copy constructor, destructor. Overload +, -, unary-, ++ (prefix, postfix), =,
comma (.), -, << and>>operators

4. Define string class with dynamic memory allocation for string. Define default
constructor, parameterized constructors, copy constructor, destructor,
Overload +, 0.-<,> operators. Observe the behavior of shallow copying
and deep copying

5. Define matrix class with dynamic memory allocation for 2-D matrix. Include
constructors, destructor, overload +(ml+m2, ml+3 & 4+m2), , << and >
operators. Also overload new and delete operators by using malloc & free
functions internally.

6. Define DSSD_STUDENT class with data members roll no, name, marks of
different modules, total marks and grade. Overload > for reading the
DSSD_STUDENT details, Overload << for displaying the DSSD_STUDENT
details, include a friend function generate results (DSSD STUDENT I. int
n); which takes an array of DSSD_STUDENT objects corresponding to n
students and generates total marks and grade for each of the student. Please
display the results of all students using overloaded<<operator. Also include
functionality to transfer the details of all objects into a file and retrieve the
details &print on the screen.

7. Define a Double ended queue class(deque). Define a Stack class by extending the
functionality of Double ended queue class. Create objects of both the classes
and test the functionality

8. Define a shape class. Derive Triangle, Square and Rectangle classes.
Demonstrate the use of virtual function by including display_area ) as a
virtual function

9. Demonstrate the use of virtual destructor with an example class hierarchy

10. Demonstrate the use of virtual base class

11. Develop a class hierarchy and demonstrate the usage of constructors in base
and derived classes.

12. Develop a class hierarchy and understand the visibility modes of members
derived from base class through various derivation (private, public and protected) modes
13. Write a program to display the marks sheet of 10th class students. Use formatted output operation, while displaying the details.

14. Define a template stack class. Using this template class, create stack objects of int,float,char* and complex type.

15. Define a template double ended queue (using array). Derive template stack and
queue classes from it. Test it for int and char* type of objects.
