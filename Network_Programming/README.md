# Network Programming

Computer Networking aims to study and analyze the communication process among various computing devices or computer systems that are linked, or networked together to exchange information and share resources. So, in order to perform networking you must have a network.

network programming involves writing computer programs that enable processes to communicate with each other across a computer network.

Network applications are everywhere. Any time you browse the Web, send an email message, or pop up an X window,
you are using a network application. Interestingly, all network applications are based on the same basic programming model, have similar
overall logical structures, and rely on the same programming interfaces
