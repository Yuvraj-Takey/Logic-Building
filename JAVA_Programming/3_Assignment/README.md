# Experiments


1. Define a class named Course having data members ID, Description, Duration
and Fees. The class should have one parametrized constructors and GetData()
function member to display the data.
-Create an array of 5 course objects and then display the data for all
of them.

2. Modify program 1 to add a default constructor and a SetData() member
function.
-Create an array of 3 student using the default constructor and another
array of 2 students using the parametrized constructor, and then display
the data of all 5 course objects.

3. Write a program to define constructors and finalize of a class and
construct 3 objects and then show that it is not a guarantee that finalizer
will be invoked for each object.

4. Write a program to demonstrate the use of final keyword with
a) class
b) method
c) data member(primitive value and reference variable and show that you
can not refer this reference variable to other objects but can change
the data field of a final reference variable)

5. write a program to demonstrate the use of following operators.
a)right shift with sign bit operator >>
b)left shift operator <<
c)right shift with zero fill operator >>>

6. write a program to demonstrate
a) Labeled break
b) Labeled continue

7. Demonstrate the use of ‘this’ keyword
a) To refer to current object.
b) Inside a constructor to call another constructor.
And also show that this can not be used in static context area.

8. Demonstrate the use of ‘super’ keyword.
a) To refer to a member of super class.
b) To call super class constructor from sub class constructor.

9. Write a program to make a request to invoke garbage collector

10. Write a program to demonstrate the use of nested class and its objects
when nested class is a
a) private member of the outer class
b) public member of the outer class.
