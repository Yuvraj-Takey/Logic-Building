# Experiments

1. Write a program to output the string "Hello World" on an independent line.

2. Write a program to read two numbers from the console, find their sum and
display the numbers and the sum on the console.

3. Write a user-defined function to find the sum of an array passed as argument.
-Write a program that declares an array of 10 elements and uses this
to
function
a) Find the sum of all elements.
b) Find the sum of first 5 elements.
c) Find the sum of last 5 elements.





4. Rework with the function and the program so that it finds the sum of elements
when the index of the starting element and the number of elements is specified.

5. Define a class of type Student that has rollno, name and age as private data
members. Define SetData() and GetData() as public member functions with
appropriate functionality.
-Write a program that declares 2 student objects, initializes the first
at run-time and second by reading from console, and then displays both
studentâ€™s data.

6. Demonstrate the access specifiers public and default with the student class
in program 5 and also demonstrate that other access specifiers(protected and
private) can not be used with class.

7. Demonstrate the use of all access specifiers(public, protected, default and
private) with the data members of student class in program 5.

8. Modify program 5 to add another array member marks to the class that stores
marks of 5 subjects and then rework with the program.

9. Define a class of type address that has street, locality and city as members.
-Rework program 5 to add to the student class an object of address class
as a data member which stores the student's address.

10. Define a class of type Distance that has Feet and Inches as members.
-Define a function that adds two Distances passed as argument and returns
the sum as another Distance object.
-Place the class in a package named user.own.pack . Compile and run the
java file using console (javac and java utility).
-Write a program that imports this package and uses class to find the sum
of two distances.

11. Write a program to swap two numbers by
a) Passing primitive values to the method (attempt to show that swapping
is not possible)
b) Creating two objects of Integer class and passing these object to
method using reference variable.

12. Write a program to demonstrate the scope and lifetime of primitive values
and class objects.

13. Modify program 5 to add
a) a private static data member counter that keeps a track of the number
of students currently existing
b) a public static function member SetCounter() that increments the
counter by one.
Demonstrate the use of these members.

14. Define an interface and show that data members of interface are by default
public, static and final and also show that method members of interface are by
default abstract and public.
